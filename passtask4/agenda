Information Updates/Reminders
=============================
* The next two weeks are going to be about understanding the
legacy Battleship code base so that we can plan for the work to
fix and improve it.
* Everyone should be able to use git, github wiki’s and Trello.
Ask for help if that’s a problem.
* We’ll be using toggl.com to keep track of time.
* The Programming Help Desk (Room E620) is available to help us with
programming for this unit.
Decisions Needed
================
* None (only general items requiring Actions this week)
General Items
=============
* Everyone needs to download the old code and make sure they can
run it.
* Need a Trello board created for this project and team. Actions
and other details will be posted there. Columns used need to be
decided. Someone needs to create and invite other team members.
* Need a Toggl team project to track the time the team uses.
Someone needs to create and invite team members (using email
addresses). We need to decide what activities to track.
* Need a github account for this project. (Project from last task
can be used if suitable.) Existing code base can be added.
* Need github wiki pages to document project details.
* Need to find and list functional issues. What works the way it
should and what does not? Put on wiki.
* Need a list of all the files, and what each file is for
(description). Decide where this is stored. Put in wiki
* Are some files (code or resources) not being used or not needed?
Create a list and share on wiki.
* What tools we can use to convert VB code to C# code? Someone (or
several) people should investigate and report back next meeting so
we can decide and then do the work of converting.
* What coding standards should we used for the project? Need
someone (or several) people to investigate and report back at the
next meeting so that we can decide.
* Are there any obvious TODO, BUG or FIXME comments in the code
base that we should know about? Someone should check and report.
* How much of the code has been documented, and once converted
what needs to be done. Someone should investigate and report.
* A list should be created to keep track of extensions ideas and
new features that could be added (not bugs to fix). The work
should not be done at this stage.
